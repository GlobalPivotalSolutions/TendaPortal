A group of school children stood in a gallery overlooking the main floor, decked out with banners and the Liberian flag. \n\nThe festivities come two days after the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared Liberia Ebola-free, 42 days since the burial of the last confirmed Ebola case.\n\nLiberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf thanked international aid organizations and humanitarian groups for coming to Liberia\u2019s aid when the news broke on Saturday, and applauded Liberia for its own work. \n\n\u201cLiberia rejoices today as we finally cross the Rubicon, defeating this unknown enemy in what some call record time,\" Sirleaf told the BBC on Saturday. \"We mourn the loss of over 4,000 of our loved ones, especially our brave doctors and healthcare workers.\"\n\n    Celebrations in Monrovia of #Liberia being declared #Ebola free by the World Health Organization.

Ebola continues to claim victims in Sierra Leone and Guinea, where health officials have had difficulty tracing new cases. \n\nThe outbreak was described the the WHO as the \"most complex outbreak\"  since Ebola first emerged in 1976. During August and September, when transmission was at its highest level, Liberia was reporting from 300 to 400 new cases of Ebola each week. \n\nOfficial #Ebola free celebrations aboeut to get underway in Monrovia #Liberia pic.twitter.com/4hGDjwaDLe\u2014 Katerina Vittozzi (@kvittozzi) May 11, 2015\n\nBut even though the Liberia is celebrating, two neighboring countries -- Guinea and Sierra Leone -- are still facing new Ebola cases. The week May 3, the last numbers officially released by the WHO, indication that Guinea and Sierra Leone each reported 9 new cases of Ebola. While this is the lowest weekly number of new cases that either country has seen so far in 2015, the WHO said in a statement it is \"important to guard against complacency.\"\n\nSirleaf echoed the calls of the World Health organization, saying Liberia will \"remain vigilant\" and continue preventative measures while working to rebuild and upgrade healthcare resources, train workers and empower communities to combat the disease. \n\nA proud lady in #Liberia as country holds official #Ebola free celebration in the capital pic.twitter.com/yxUxcrPvEC\u2014 Katerina Vittozzi (@kvittozzi) May 11, 2015\n\nThe president of Togo along with guests from the African Union, Ghana and Nigeria attended the Liberian event on Monday.\n\nLiberia's Chief Justice Francis Korkpor called the Ebola crisis \"an unprovoked attack on our nation that posed a serious threat to the survival of our existence.\"\n\nSome reporting from the Associated Press.\r\n Have something to add to this story?

Ebola is a precedent.\u201d \n\nThis warning, featured in a searing documentary from PBS\u2019 Frontline that airs Tuesday nationwide, comes from Dr. Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization, who was at the center of troubled efforts to curb the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. \n\nThe episode, like many aired by the award-winning journalism program, is at once infuriating, frightening and mobilizing. It should also be required viewing for anyone who wants to know more about the outbreak than panicked panels of pundits on CNN, or ambulance chases from airports in Western nations where a handful of health workers were treated.\n\nSee also: Ebola Author Says Outbreak Is 'Part of a Pattern' of Emerging, Deadly Diseases\n\nThe documentary sounds the alarm: The world was not prepared to deal with a disease that crossed borders and spread rapidly. More outbreaks like this one will occur as new diseases emerge from an increasingly crowded and resource-constrained world, especially one in which people are encroaching into previously wild habitat. \n\nThat provides ideal conditions for so-called zoonotic diseases to jump from species to species. \n\nThe hour-long episode is a damning indictment of everyone who failed to save lives when they had the chance. The government ministers in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are blamed, as well as the bumbling bureaucracy of the U.N.\u2019s World Health Organization (WHO). None of them saw the onslaught before it was right on top of them.\n\nUltimately, the outbreak killed at least 10,892 people, according to the latest tally (though the documentary notes the actual tally is likely far higher). The episode does not waste time rehashing what we already knew about the disease, and puts the focus on putting a human face on those who suffered the most.\n\nFilmmaker and journalist Dan Edge spent four months in West Africa, retracing Ebola\u2019s steps back to a single tree at the remote Meliandu village in Guinea. That's where it is thought that bats -- a suspected disease reservoir for Ebola and other pathogens -- first transmitted the disease to humans in December of 2014, well before anyone at the CDC in Atlanta or the WHO in Geneva heard about the outbreak. \n\nIn an interview with Mashable, Edge says one key lesson that emerged from his team\u2019s reporting is that the disease surveillance in West Africa, and indeed much of the developing world, is \u201cwoefully inadequate.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Ebola, the outbreak \u201cwas not identified as an Ebola outbreak for nearly four months,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is not set up in such a way to deal with cross-border epidemics.\u201d\n\nOne key piece of evidence that the documentary details: The role that a small American company, Metabiota of San Francisco, played in advising the Sierra Leonean government in how to respond to the building crisis. \n\nThe company already had a presence in the country researching tropical diseases. By its own admission, the company had no experience dealing with Ebola. Still, the government listened to its input rather than humanitarian groups on the front lines, like Doctors Without Borders, which had extensive experience handling Ebola cases and was sounding the alarm to anyone who would listen that the outbreak was way out of control and spreading fast.\n\nInterestingly, Metabiota staff published a peer reviewed study on April 20 in PLOS Currents Outbreaks on Ebola\u2019s emergence in Sierra Leone. The study makes no mention of the company\u2019s role in advising the government on the proper response to contain the outbreak. \n\n\u201cHealthcare systems must be immediately alerted and communication through regional networks must be enacted in a manner that permits quick adaptation to the rapidly evolving situation,\u201d the study, published April 20, says about a successful Ebola intervention program.\n\nPerhaps no organization emerges from this episode more bruised than the WHO, which is headquartered in Geneva. \n\nEdge says it was obvious that the WHO, which exists to aid governments in responding to public health threats, was \u201cimpotent\u201d in the face of the outbreak -- but this was partly by design. \u201cThey had no army of medics ready to deploy,\" he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not a clinical organization.\u201d\n\nThat should change, Edge says: \u201cNow is the time, the small window of opportunity when the horror of the outbreak is still very fresh in our minds.\" \n\nThe WHO announced reforms late last month that would address some of the shortcomings. But Edge is not optimistic they\u2019ll be acted upon. \n\nWhile filming in remote Guinea, where deforestation and mining is encroaching on more formerly wild territory, Edge says was aware of how quickly he could have traveled to the capital, then hopped a flight to London or Paris or New York.\n\n\u201cThe world is connected in a way that it never has been before,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no such thing as a far-away place anymore.\u201d"},"shares":{"facebook":81,"twitter":745,"google_plus":46,"total":872},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzA1LzA1L2UyL1NpcmxlYWZfT3V0Ljg3YjZjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/9cd36817/197/Sirleaf_Outbreak.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzA1LzA1L2UyL1NpcmxlYWZfT3V0Ljg3YjZjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/1812c70d/197/Sirleaf_Outbreak.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzA1LzA1L2UyL1NpcmxlYWZfT3V0Ljg3YjZjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTIwMHgxMTUjCmUJanBn/f50de09e/197/Sirleaf_Outbreak.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzA1LzA1L2UyL1NpcmxlYWZfT3V0Ljg3YjZjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTQwMHgyMzAjCmUJanBn/47cfda5d/197/Sirleaf_Outbreak.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1zxj7Xc","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2014/10/12/david-quammen-ebola-pattern/"}]},"excerpt":"The episode, like many aired by the award-winning journalism program, is at times infuriating, frightening and mobilizing.

Before now, the longest period of time the virus was detected in semen was 101 days.\n\nThere are currently no proven cases of Ebola passing from a recovered patient to a partner through sex, but public health agencies say they cannot rule out the possibility.\n\nThe WHO is holding a meeting of medical experts later this week where researchers are expected to provide an update on the case, Epstein said. The group will review the latest evidence in hopes of determining the duration that the virus can last in other bodily fluids such as vaginal or eye fluid and whether the virus is actually still infectious or simply genetic material.\n\nThe new evidence may raise questions about how public health officials should continue to respond to the waning epidemic, which, as of Tuesday, had sickened 25,872 and killed 10,721 across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the countries with widespread transmission, per the CDC.\n\nAs with the treatment of HIV and AIDS, governments and health organizations must tread carefully when dealing with sexual transmission in order to avoid stigmatizing survivors and respect victims' privacy.\n\nThe WHO advises governments in order to avoid inflicting undue harm on survivors, instead recommending that they \"promote the demonstration of respect, dignity and compassion towards all survivors, their partners and families,\" \n\nThe New York Times reported that health officials in Sierra Leone are facing accusations of acting with duress when seeking a semen sample from a man who claimed to be impotent. The WHO has also received reports of Ebola survivors accused of infecting partners being detained in the country.\n\nThe epidemic in West Africa is the largest of its kind in history, according to the CDC. Health officials said the epidemic was winding down earlier this year as the number of reported cases began to dwindle. \n\nTugbah became Liberia's first Ebola patient in nearly three weeks last month, dashing the country's hopes of meeting the WHO-mandated 42-day timeframe needed to be declared Ebola-free.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

At a conference in Washington on Friday, the World Bank revealed new data showing the extreme economic impacts that the disease has had on Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, where the economy had been growing rapidly before the outbreak hit last year, the effects of Ebola and a simultaneous collapse of the mining sector resulted in the likelihood of \"an unprecedented GDP contraction\" that is now estimated at 23.5%. \n\nSee also: Eyewitness to Hell: Life in Ebola-Ravaged Liberia\n\nSierra Leone's economy lost $1.4 billion as a result of the outbreak, according to new World Bank data. \n\nTo put that into perspective, the country's total GDP for all of 2013 was $4.2 billion. \n\nPart of the reason why Sierra Leone was hit so hard had to do with the country's mining sector, which shut down due to both a lack of labor as well as a steep drop in international iron ore prices, the latter of which had nothing to do with Ebola. Iron ore was the worst performing commodity on global markets in 2014, with prices falling by 50%.\n\nGuinea lost $535 million due to the outbreak, the World Bank found, while Liberia suffered a smaller loss in GDP of about $240 million. \n\nThe World Bank projects that Liberia will be the only country affected by Ebola that will still see economic growth this year, but at a slower rate than was originally predicted before the disease struck. \n\nOn Friday, the World Bank Group announced new financing of at least $650 million during the next year and a half to help the three countries recover and develop. Other countries also pledged additional financing. \n\n\u201cEven as we work relentlessly to get to zero new Ebola cases, the international community must help Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone jumpstart their recovery and build a safer, more prosperous and resilient future for their people,\u201d said Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank Group. \u201cMany of us have acknowledged that the international community was slow to react to Ebola. Let\u2019s show that we have learned this lesson by supporting an effective and sustainable recovery that also prepares these countries\u2014and the rest of the world\u2014for the next pandemic.\u201d\r\n \r\nWhile the outbreak has significantly diminished in recent weeks, it is not yet fully extinguished. As of April 17, the outbreak had killed 10,702 people and sickened thousands more. \n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), in the week leading up to April 12, there were a total of 37 confirmed cases of Ebola, compared with 30 the previous week. The disease is mainly ongoing in Guinea and Sierra Leone, with only one new confirmed cases of Ebola reported in Liberia since late March."},"shares":{"facebook":62,"twitter":806,"total":868},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzA0LzE3L2Q5L1NpZXJyYUxlb25lLmRhMWEwLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/61bb6d2d/d65/Sierra-Leone-President.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzA0LzE3L2Q5L1NpZXJyYUxlb25lLmRhMWEwLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/176a82cc/d65/Sierra-Leone-President.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzA0LzE3L2Q5L1NpZXJyYUxlb25lLmRhMWEwLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTIwMHgxMTUjCmUJanBn/e925ebb1/d65/Sierra-Leone-President.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzA0LzE3L2Q5L1NpZXJyYUxlb25lLmRhMWEwLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTQwMHgyMzAjCmUJanBn/bea64480/d65/Sierra-Leone-President.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1E9Dqf8","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2014/10/24/ebola-liberia-hell-photographer/"}]},"excerpt":"The Ebola outbreak has reversed economic growth in some African countries, sending Sierra Leone in particular into an \"unprecedented\" economic tailspin.","channel":"World","channel_label":"World","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/world/"},{"_id":"552d7d4db05f9d4bde00119d","id":"2015/04/14/schools-sierra-leone-after-ebola","title":"Life after Ebola: The first day of school in Sierra Leone","title_tag":null,"author":"Dustin Drankoski","post_date":"2015-04-14T20:49:02+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 20:49:02 +0000","sort_key":"1yIt5x","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/04/14/schools-sierra-leone-after-ebola/","content":{"plain":"FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- Thirteen-year-old Aminata Lappia is from Matoi village in northern Sierra Leone.

Up until Friday, there hadn't been a new case of Ebola in the country for 20 days, the BBC reported.\n\nThe woman arrived at the emergency room of Monrovia's Redemption Hospital on Thursday night, according to Elizabeth Hamann of the International Rescue Committee, which is helping the hospital reopen amid the outbreak. The woman was identified as a suspected Ebola case and put in the hospital's isolation unit, while awaiting test results. She is now at a treatment center.\n\nIn a worrying sign, it is unclear where the woman became infected. She doesn't seem to be linked to any of the people on an Ebola contacts list, and has said that she did not travel to an infected country, according to Kateh.\n\nHe said authorities were considering the possibility that the woman had a visitor from outside Liberia who infected her, or that she had sex with a survivor. The Ebola virus can be found in the semen of survivors for up to three months, and health authorities recommend that survivors abstain from sex during that period.\n\nAn emergency meeting will be held Saturday to discuss the case.\n\nAlthough hopes were high that Liberia had beaten Ebola, officials knew that until two neighboring countries \u2014 Sierra Leone and Guinea \u2014 also beat the disease, Liberia would remain at risk. \"We knew very well that we were not out of the woods yet,\" Nyenswah said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mashable\n\n Have something to add to this story?

Boots that are too big.\"\n\nNurse practitioner Patricia Carrick is helping me into Ebola personal protective equipment (PPE), just like the suit she wore on assignment in Sierra Leone 21 days ago, the second of a pair of two-month stints there. We're in the \"Ebola Treatment Unit\" constructed inside the convention center at TED Vancouver.\n\nMy size seven foot bounces around the size nine boot. I ask if that means the virus can creep in easier. \"Actually, the real risk is clumsiness,\" she says. \"Try not to fall.\"\n\nThe Gates Foundation is sponsoring the Suiting Up for Ebola experience here at TED, as part of a new push to help combat emerging epidemics before they spiral out of control. \n\nShe says large boots were common in the field, since the number of health care workers outnumbered the appropriately sized foot gear. Often, Carrick says, you're left with what's available.\n\nSee also: 5 Unbelievable Ocean Mysteries We Still Haven't Solved\n\nNext, she stretches on blue surgical gloves, one of few constants across the variety of Ebola gear you see from different regions and different medical groups. \n\nPat steps back, looks me up and down and chooses a size large, yellow suit. \"You're tall,\" she says, zipping it closed over my chest. \n\nThe suit is huge, roomy and full of air in the stomach, arms and legs. That part is fine, she reassures me. It's important that the length covers most of your boots. I peek down \u2014 it seems\u2026 okay. At least the elastic around my ankles is tight. \n\nShe chooses a white surgical mask next. It's heavy, not like the cotton face bibs you see on Grey's Anatomy. She instructs me to hold it under my eyes as I pull the first of two elastic bands behind my head. \n\n\"Tuck your hair behind your ears first,\" she says. The mask sits high up on my nose; the top is sharp and pokes the bottom of my eyes. \"Now squeeze the metal pin around your nose,\" Pat instructs. \n\nI do as instructed, but it's already getting hard to breathe.\n\nAnd we're not even halfway through the suiting process. \n\nBill Gates, who is speaking later in the day, intends to make the process uncomfortable. He wants people to know what it takes to work on the front lines of highly dangerous and infectious environments, including Ebola. \n\n\"Right now, the world isn't ready to fight a highly infectious disease,\" a Gates Foundation press release states. \"In fact, of all the things that could kill more than 10 million people around the world in the years ahead, by far the most likely is an epidemic, from either natural causes or bioterrorism.\"\n\nAlthough Ebola outbreaks have virtually ceased in Liberia, cases have ticked up recently in Guinea and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization. And no one knows for sure what disease is next.\n\nHis talk will urge additional steps to prepare for a far worse epidemic and improve treatment. \n\nI wonder how much better the suiting process alone could get, and how quickly improvements could be made.\n\nI pull the hood over my head. I thought this would be the worst part, but the mask is still stifling my breath. The white hood is relatively light and covers my entire head, minus a small window for my eyes. \n\nNext, the second pair of gloves, this time white. Pat puts them on for me, careful to cover the suit hem around my wrists. \n\nThe goggles remind me of my high school chemistry class, but a little heavier. I secure them around my eyes first, then pull the elastic band behind my head and over my hood. \n\nIt's getting hotter in the suit. I find that rather than asking questions like a good journalist should, I'm eager to get this over with. I breathe as slowly as possible.\n\nPat leads me over to a floor-length mirror next. \"Here's something a lot of people forget,\" she says, reaching up to tuck tiny portions of my hood under my goggles, around my nose. They were exposed. Pat says she's rushed to get into clothes before, only to have her buddy pull her back to tuck in this precious component. \n\nShe ties a cumbersome black apron around my front, introduces me to my \"buddy\" Glen, and I'm off to \"treat patients\" in the next room. \n\n\"Wait!\" she pulls me back. \n\nOh no, I think, did I do something wrong? Am I exposed?\n\nShe uncaps a black Sharpie and writes something on my forehead. I look in the mirror one last time. It reads \"Stephanie,\" because now, but for my eyes, I'm completely unrecognizable. \n\nThe entire dressing process took about 10 minutes, and we didn't even take all the normal precautions.\n\nGlen and I pass from the \"donning\" (dressing) station to the \"ward.\" \n\nImagine you're walking through 95-degree weather into a hot and stuffy room, my handlers instruct. You're encountering dozens of sick patients; the room is covered in Ebola. \n\nI realize I'm sweating profusely, and I'm walking through a comfortable, air-conditioned conference room, nowhere near the brutal conditions doctors and patients in West Africa face every day. I suck in deep breaths of air and tell myself it will be over in a few minutes. Real doctors and nurses don't have that luxury.\n\nDr. Luanne Freer says she watched a colleague of hers encounter a baby who'd just died of Ebola. He was traumatized, and in a panic started tearing off his suit in the middle of an infected ward. His buddy had to hold him and calm him down.\n\n\"You have to say, 'Look in my eyes, take deep breaths, think about what you're doing,' she tells me. \"That's why having a buddy is so important.\" \n\nWe're not treating Ebola patients today. The handlers instruct Glen to stack numbered boxes, while I hold an IV drop high above my head for two minutes, squeezing saline out of the bag. Glen concentrates on dropping \"medicine\" into cups: two orange Skittles, two green and one red. I'm a little jealous of Glen, who is having trouble remembering which color Skittles he needs to collect; at least he's distracted from his anxiety. I'm just standing there, my gloves slippery around my sweating hands. \n\nAfter we're finished with our tasks, we move through the tent to the \"doffing\" station, where we're to undress. It's the riskiest part of the process, everyone has warned me throughout the entire exercise. \n\nDr. Freer, who volunteered to treat patients in Sierra Leone for six weeks, greets me and instructs me to immediately wash my gloved hands. There's a sink nearby, but we're just pretending today. Normally, you'd wash your hands in one-minute increments\u2026about 20 times throughout the undressing period. Do the math.\n\nGlen and I stand with our arms held out from our sides. I realize no one has instructed us to do this. It's a reflex when you feel covered in a deadly virus. \n\nImmediately, we're sprayed down with a chlorine solution. Typically, this happens in the field for about one minute. \n\nNext, remove your apron facing forward so it slips off your body without splashing. \n\nWash your hands.\n\nSomeone sprays my suit again, under the apron, especially the zipper. \n\nWash your hands.\n\nRemove your outer gloves, careful to touch only the insides. \n\nWash your hands. \n\nClose your eyes and remove your goggles by pulling them out dramatically from your face and lifting off. \n\nWash your hands. \n\nClose your eyes. Reach behind your hood and pluck it off from your face and head. \n\nWash your hands. \n\nUnzip your suit, pulling it out from your body by the front. \n\n\"Now here's the yoga portion,\" says Dr. Freer. \"We call it the Ebola shuffle.\" Pull your suit down by your shoulders. Then sit on your haunches and tuck the suit down under your butt. From there, you're not meant to touch the suit at all. You're supposed to \"shimmy\" out of it by shaking your legs. I try to do so, but my size nine boots slip off. I have to use my hands, which is a no-no. \n\nWash your hands.\n\nMy mask is next, the worst part. Even with my suit and hood off, it's still hot, sticking to my face with sweat. Dr. Freer says the scariest thing she experiences in the suit is her sweat. She's afraid of it. \"You're sweating inside your goggles and literally waterboarding yourself,\" she tells me. \"Breathing through bubbles in your mask.\" \n\nOnce when she took off her suit and boots, she poured out nearly a cup of her own sweat. Most days she loses liters worth.\r\n \r\nI tear off my mask, far too quickly. The cool air in my lungs is a dream. \n\nWash your hands. \n\nFinally, I remove my blue surgical gloves, inside out. The insides are slick with sweat. \n\nI look over at Glen and realize they gave him a cooling vest. I touch it; it's squishy and cool, as if filled with freezer packs.\n\n\"Man, I'm glad they gave me this,\" he says. \"And I'm still burning up.\"\n\nWash your hands. \n\nI exit the doffing station and treatment unit to sit down after about 25 minutes of dressing, treating and undressing. The staff has given me a bottle of water, a Wet Wipe to dab my sweaty hands and forehead.\n\n\"Am I going to get Ebola in here?\" asks a conference attendee who enters the room in curiosity. \n\nAbsolutely not, responds the staff. It's early in the day and they're eager to share their experience \u2014 but not for people prone to fainting or claustrophobia. I didn't think I was, but any more time in that suit and I might have. \n\nIt's a tiny, humble fraction of the nightmarish landscape for Ebola patients and their caregivers in West Africa. Their work is invaluable, responsible for keeping a deadly virus as contained as possible. The Gates Foundation simulation reminds us this vocation is certainly not for everyone, that we need to be grateful for the health workers risking their lives and testing their mental health on the front lines of infectious diseases every day. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

The patient is being treated at the National Institutes of Health's hospital near Washington.\n\nSee also: Internet offers help to homeless Sierra Leone athlete whose family died of Ebola\n\nThe patient was flown in isolation from Sierra Leone on a chartered plane last week and arrived early Friday morning. The patient's name, age and gender have not been released.\n\nThe patient is a clinician working with Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit organization. The group has been treating patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone since November.\n\nThe latest NIH patient is the 11th person with Ebola to be treated in the U.S. Two patients in the U.S. have died: a man treated in Dallas after contracting the virus in Africa and a doctor evacuated from Africa to Nebraska when he was already critically ill.\n\nThe man in Dallas had contracted the virus in his native Liberia. He transmitted the disease to two nurses, resulting in widespread concern in the U.S., with questions raised about emergency department screening of patients, monitoring of ill travelers from Africa and even disputes over the disposal of potentially infectious waste from hospitals.\n\nThe World Health Organization has estimated the virus has killed more than 10,000 people, mostly in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The current outbreak is the largest ever for the disease. While deaths have slowed dramatically in recent months, the virus appears stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone.\n\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman said that besides the patient at NIH, there are 11 other Partners in Health workers being brought to the United States for monitoring. That includes four going to Atlanta to be near Emory University Hospital; one arrived Friday. On Saturday, four health care workers arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, and three arrived in the Washington area on Sunday to be near the NIH campus in Bethesda.\n\nOne of those being monitored in Nebraska has developed symptoms of Ebola and was being moved to a biocontainment unit, hospital officials said in a news release Monday.

Just this week, new patients arrived in U.S. hospitals for treatment. But back in Africa where healthcare workers have battled hundreds of cases at a time, officials are struggling to find smart solutions that can help ensure the safety of caregivers, offer more comprehensive and speedy care and add 21st century solutions to their disease-fighting arsenal.\n\nWearable technology is very close to joining the fight.\n\nOn Saturday at SXSW, The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) unveiled both a new biomedical suit and the MultiSense Memory wearable sensor: Two innovations that point to a new way of tackling the world\u2019s poverty, health and disaster response issues facing a 54-year-old agency that was actually created through the same presidential order as the Peace Corps. In fact, even the way these tools were developed is new.\n\nSee also: 3 Basic Reasons You Shouldn't Freak Out About Ebola\n\n\u201cUsually we issue an RFA or RFP and we get usual suspects for proposal. This is a new approach to open it to more people through something called \u2018Grand Challenge,\u2019\u201d Ann Mei Chang, the executive director of the U.S. Global Development Lab, told Mashable.\n\nUSAID, which is tasked with ending extreme poverty and often acts as an early responder at disasters like the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Japan\u2019s 2011 tsunami and the recent Ebola outbreak, received over 1,500 suit submissions. The winner is a suit developed by Johns Hopkins lab. It\u2019s a one piece garment, takes two minutes to put on, has anti-fogging and, eventually, a built-in cooling system. By contrast, the original suits were complicated, multi-piece numbers that took 30 minutes to put on. They were hot (their boots would literally fill with sweat), uncomfortable and doctors could only wear them for 45 minutes at a time.  \n\nIt could be a little while before the suit reaches Africa, but in a \u201ccouple of months we\u2019ll get some of the elements of that suit into the field,\u201d said Wendy Taylor, of the USAID Center for Accelerating Innovation.\n\nEven with a new biomedical suit in the wings, doctors in the field still face significant challenges. \u201cTools are hard to use in an Ebola setting -- you can\u2019t use a stethoscope,\u201d said Taylor.\n\nWith the MultiSense Memory patch or \"smart \u201cBand-Aid,\u201d as Taylor likes to call it, they won\u2019t need a stethoscope. It\u2019s a flexible, sensor-rich-patch that attaches to the sternum of a patient with adhesive (like a Band-Aid), takes a baseline vital rating -- heart rate, temp and oxygen saturation -\u2013 and then measures all changes from the baseline. \n\nMore importantly, doctors will be able to place the sensors on patients and then track their vitals from outside the hot zone. The prototype uses a USB cable to transmit data, but the final version will use Bluetooth and doctors will monitor, for instance, all the patients in a tent from one screen.\n\nThe device, which costs $100 per patch, will have 7 to 10 days of battery life. USAID executives told us that, once in treatment, the average Ebola case runs its course in five days.\n\nUSAID's Taylor calls the patch a \"game changer.\"\n\nThe rubber sensors are disposable, said Taylor, but when we asked her about how the rubber would be disposed, she said most of what\u2019s used in treatment is incinerated. She assumes it will be burned, but then added that that may have to be worked out.\n\nRegardless, the MultiSense Memory patch is a reminder that wearable technology isn\u2019t always about fashion. Sometimes it\u2019s about saving lives. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

Sierrra Leone's top 100 metre sprinter arrived in Glasgow burning with ambition to bring home some medals. For him, the Commonwealth Games was \"the big one.\"\n\nHowever, back home the Ebola outbreak was accelerating, and during his trip he heard that his adoptive uncle had died. While he competed in the 100m x 100m relay, the news devastated Thoronka and derailed the competition.\n\nHe says that there were no flights to Sierra Leone after the tournament and his team mates scattered. Thanks to this, and a stolen passport, he overstayed his visa when it expired last September, and after a brief stay at a friend's house he ended up living rough on the streets in London, afraid to contact the Home Office.\n\nDuring these months he learnt that his adoptive mother and three adopted sisters and brother had also all died from Ebola. As he'd been separated from his biological parents during the civil war in the '90s, these were a second family - now all gone.\n\nThroughout the biting London winter he scraped by, carrying around a small rucksack containing, according to the Guardian, a phone, toothbrush, a spare pair of underpants and trousers, and a packet of paracetamol from a pound shop.\n\nThoronka was discovered by police last Friday. He was arrested, searched and detained for 27 hours at Walworth Police Station. While there he lodged an asylum claim with the Home Office.\n\nOffers of help\n\nSince the story broke last week, offers of help have flooded in. Dozens of people showed up at the police station with food and clothes, and several people from Edinburgh to Brighton have pledged a place to stay.\n\nAn online GoFundMe campaign has raised \u00a320,000 ($30,000) in three days.\n\nA petition calling for the Home Office to \"give Jimmy the chance to start a new life and realise his huge potential as a sprinting star\", meanwhile, has attracted nearly 60,000 supporters. Another asking for his deportation to be halted has nearly 5,000.\n\nRichard Dent, who set up the first petition, said he wanted to help Thoronka \"rebuild his life and career\".\n\n\"Obviously Jimmy broke his visa which wasn't great. But I believe he did this because he had a genuine fear for his life whilst under incredible stress given the loss of his family to Ebola,\" he said.\n\n\"In my opinion, this is not an issue of supporting deliberate illegal immigration, this is about being humanitarians.\"\n\nThoronka wants to be the next Usain Bolt. \u201cIf I had not come to the Commonwealth Games I probably would have died of Ebola along with the rest of my family,\" he said. \"I believe I was meant to survive so I can succeed in my dream to be the best sprinter in the world.\u201d\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Ebola outbreak in West Africa\n\nThe Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) has created this up-to-date data visualization on the Ebola outbreak using information from several sources, including the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response and the World Health Organization. The information is broken down by country and district, and includes the total numbers of treatment centers, people receiving food assistance and response plan coverage.\n\nExplore the interactive visualization here.\n\n2. Life expectancy and probability of death\n\nThis project from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) illustrates how life expectancy and probability of death changed between 1990 and 2013 in 188 countries.\n\nExplore which health issues caused changes in life expectancy by country, as well as the probability of death by age group, location, sex and year. Click here to see the interactive data visualization in action.\n\n3. Millennium Development Goals\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the United Nations' blueprint to tackle a number of global problems by a target date of 2015, included several health-related issues. This graphic, also created by the IHME, includes extensive data on child mortality, maternal mortality, the spread of HIV and AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.\n\nClick here to see the full interactive.\n\n4. New HIV diagnoses\n\nHIVContinuum is an interactive map from AIDSVu, a project based at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. It shows new HIV diagnoses, late HIV diagnoses, linkage and engagement to HIV care, and more.\n\nUsers can look at city-specific data for Atlanta, Chicago, New Orleans, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., and also filter by sex, race and ethnicity, and age.\n\n5. Vaccine-preventable outbreaks\n\nLoading...\n\nAs the measles outbreak linked to Disneyland began to spread in January 2015, a heated debate resurged surrounding the importance of vaccinations.\n\nThe Global Health Program at the Council on Foreign Relations created this data visualization, which plots global outbreaks of measles, mumps, whooping cough, polio, rubella and other preventable diseases.\n\nTo see the larger version, click here. \n\n6. Overweight and obesity patterns\n\nThe IHME released this interactive graphic in May 2014, highlighting global overweight and obesity prevalence in adults between 1980 and 2013. The data comes from a variety of surveys, reports and published studies.\n\nUsers can filter data by body mass index (BMI), age (20 years old and above), sex and location. See the full interactive visualization here.\n\n7. Malnutrition and other public health problems\n\n   \n\nThe International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) released its first-ever annual Global Nutrition Report, a comprehensive analysis on the state of the world's nutrition, in November 2014. This data visualization uses information from the report, illustrating several types of widespread malnutrition around the world.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

She kept thanking God and the health workers at the center.\n\nSee also: Eyewitness to Hell: Life in Ebola-Ravaged Liberia\n\nYardolo said she had been admitted to the Chinese-run Ebola treatment center in the Paynesville district of Monrovia on Feb. 18. A mother of five, she is originally from the northeastern county of Nimba near the borders with Guinea and Ivory Coast, but lives in Monrovia where she teaches at a church-run school. The St. Paul's Bridge community where she resides and teaches had become the last \"hotspot\" for Ebola cases in Monrovia, according to Tolbert Nyenswah, Assistant Health Minister and head of the country's Ebola response.\n\nThere are no other confirmed cases of Ebola in the country, and as such Liberia can begin to count up to 42 days to be declared Ebola free in keeping with World Health Organization protocols and standards, Nyenswah said Wednesday. He challenged all Liberians to commit themselves to achieving \"zero Ebola infections\" by rigidly abiding by the anti-Ebola regulations.\n\nLiberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has said no country can be declared Ebola free until all the other countries have no cases.\n\nSierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea have been hardest hit in the yearlong Ebola outbreak, which is estimated to have left more than 9,800 people dead.\n\nThe WHO on Wednesday reported 132 new Ebola cases last week, an increase from the 99 cases reported the previous week. The agency said the spread of Ebola remains \"widespread\" in Sierra Leone and noted that cases have jumped both there and in Guinea.\n\nNine new cases were reported in a 24-hour period, according to an update from the Sierra Leone government on Tuesday.\n\nWHO said only about half of new Ebola patients in Guinea are connected to known cases, meaning that health officials are unable to track where the disease is spreading in the other half of cases.\n\nThe U.N. health agency has said it will start large-scale testing of an experimental Ebola vaccine in Guinea on Saturday to see how effective it might be in preventing future outbreaks of the deadly virus.\n\nThe health agency's vaccination strategy in Guinea aims to create a buffer zone around an Ebola case to prevent its further spread.

The rules applied to diplomats, NGO workers and even senior North Korean officials returning from overseas trips.\n\nOne tour company that takes tourists into North Korea, Uri Tours, said on its website Tuesday that it had been told by the country's national airline that the ban had been lifted.\n\nSee also: North Korea debuts 310 slogans: 'Let us turn ours into a country of mushrooms'\n\n\"We have been informed by Air Koryo that North Korea's borders are now open for travel and the four-month long Ebola travel ban was lifted as of Monday,\" Uri Tours said.\n\nOfficials in Pyongyang said the restrictions and quarantines would continue for visitors from Ebola-affected countries in Africa and those countries that have borders with them.\n\nNorth Korean media had suggested the Ebola virus was created by the U.S. military for use as a biological weapon.\n\nNorth Korea's decision to set the restrictions despite the lack of any real threat -- there have been no Ebola cases in Asia and North Korea has very little exchange with the African countries that have been most impacted -- has been a disaster for foreign travel agencies that specialize in bringing tourists to the North.\n\nA statement from North Korea's state emergency quarantine committee obtained by the Associated Press on Tuesday said tourists from Ebola-hit countries such as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and their neighboring countries would still be placed in the three-week quarantine, while tourists from other countries would be able to enter with routine medical checks.\n\nNorth Korea had been pushing tourism in hopes of gaining much-needed foreign currency and has over the past few years tried to improve its tourism infrastructure. Last year, it opened its first luxury ski resort and it has announced the establishment of a number of special tourism zones across the country. It is mainly targeting tourists from China, but an increasing number of tourists are coming from the West as well.\n\n\"They have confirmed to me that the borders are now open and everything is back to normal,\" Andrea Lee, the New Jersey-based Uri Tours' CEO, said in an email. \"As we need about two weeks to process visas, we're planning to start tours again from the middle of March.\"\n\nBut the lifting of the restrictions appears to come too late for one of the year's biggest tourist events.\n\nOfficials have already announced that foreigners will not be able to participate in the Pyongyang marathon next month, although they might have time to reverse that decision. The marathon was opened to foreign recreational runners for the first time last year and was a big success. The marathon offers a unique view of the city for tourists.\n\nTravel agents said they expected hundreds of runners from abroad to join this year, but had to cancel their bookings at the last minute.\n\nUri Tours said it is waiting for more information to see what the lifting of the ban means for the marathon.\n\nNorth Korea has also indicated that it will not hold its popular Arirang mass games extravaganza this year. The mass games are another big tourist attraction.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mashable\n\nHave something to add to this story?

But on Monday, travel agencies who operate in North Korea confirmed that Ebola fears will prevent foreign participation this year.\n\nSee also: Kim Jong-un has a new haircut and of course it's epic\n\nIn October, the country shut out foreign tourists with some of the strictest Ebola regulations in the world. North Korean media have suggested Ebola was created by the U.S. military as a biological weapon.\n\nNo cases of Ebola have been reported anywhere near North Korea, but that hasn't stopped officials from taking severe precautions. \n\nThe travel ban comes amid reports leader Kim Jong-un has called for increased combat readiness and, at a meeting of senior party and military leaders, described tensions on the peninsula as graver than ever before. North Korea has been under increasing pressure from the U.N. over its human rights record and is facing new sanctions from Washington over its alleged involvement in the massive cyberattack on Sony Pictures in December. Sony says the hack cost the company an estimated $15 million.\n\nNick Bonner, cofounder of Beijing-based Koryo Tours, said more than 400 foreign runners had signed up with his agency alone for the marathon. He said he was informed by officials on Monday that the race -- billed as one of the most exotic marathon locales on Earth -- would be open only to local runners. Another agency specializing in North Korea travel, Young Pioneer Tours, also confirmed on its website that it was canceling its tours for the event.\n\nBonner told the Associated Press he remains hopeful the Ebola restrictions will be lifted by the end of March.\n\nThat would be too late for foreigners hoping to run in the marathon though, as restrictions have interfered with race tour planning.\n\nLast year's race through the streets of Pyongyang, including a 10-kilometer (6-mile) competition and a half marathon along with the full course, was opened up to foreign recreational runners for the first time and was a big success. Elite runners from around the world are usually brought in for the main event. Bonner said they apparently won't be allowed in this year.\n\nKnown officially as the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon, the race is sanctioned as a bronze-label event by the International Association of Athletics Federations and has been held annually for 27 years. It is held in conjunction with a series of sporting competitions, arts festivals and cultural events marking the birthday of North Korea's founder, Kim Il-sung, on April 15.\n\nSince the Ebola measures were announced last October, visas for nonessential travel have been halted and, regardless of country or region of origin, all foreigners allowed in are technically subject to quarantine under medical observation for 21 days.\n\nThat includes diplomats and international aid workers, though they are allowed to stay in their residences or diplomatic compounds. Even senior North Korean officials returning from trips abroad have been quarantined.\n\nThe restrictions have been a disaster for travel agents.\n\nAndrea Lee, of New Jersey-based Uri Tours, said 200 runners had signed up with her agency.\n\n\"We have not been able to run tours for several months. As a small business, it's been a difficult time,\" she said. \"We expect tours to resume at the latest by the summer.\"\n\nNorth Korea has made a concerted effort to bolster its tourist trade in recent years by setting up special tourism zones and developing scenic areas and recreational facilities.\n\nThere was even a summer camp where foreign youth could interact with local children.\n\nBonner said the group that had signed up for the marathon this year was the biggest his agency has put together in 10 years, and would have been one of the largest groups ever.\n\nAdditional reporting by the Associated Press\n\nHave something to add to this story?

At this moment in time Ebola is the single greatest threat to the survival of gorillas and chimpanzees.\n\nThe virus is even more deadly for other great apes as it is for humans, with mortality rates approximately 95% for gorillas and 77% for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Current estimates suggest a third of the world's gorillas and chimpanzees have died from Ebola since the 1990s.\n\nAs with humans, these deaths tend to come in epidemics. In 1995, an outbreak is reported to have killed more than 90% of the gorillas in Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 Park in northern Gabon. In 2002-2003 a single outbreak of ZEBOV (the Zaire strain of Ebola) in the Democratic Republic of Congo killed an estimated 5,000 Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). It's hard to accurately count such elusive creatures but the WWF estimates there are up to 100,000 left in the wild -- so a single Ebola outbreak wiped out a considerable chunk of the world's gorilla population.\n\nThere are of course additional factors behind the declining numbers of Africa's great apes: illegal trading in wildlife and bushmeat, war, deforestation and other infectious diseases. The world's remaining wild apes are being increasingly forced into isolated pockets of forest, which impedes their ability to forage, breed and to hide from hunters. There is also a growing body of evidence linking deforestation and subsequent changes in climate to the spread of Ebola and other infectious diseases.\n\nBack in 2003 an article on the decline of great apes, written by a team led by primatologist Peter Walsh, predicted that:\n\nWithout aggressive investments in law enforcement, protected area management and Ebola prevention, the next decade will see our closest relatives pushed to the brink of extinction.\n\nSadly, this prediction appears to have come true. Since 2008, the IUCN has listed the Eastern Gorilla (Gorilla beringei) as endangered and the Western Gorillas as critically endangered. If we do not act fast, these may prove to be the last decades in which apes can continue to live in their natural habitat. Unfortunately, there appears to be a lack of political will to implement policies which would bring viable solutions into effect.\n\nWe need both short-term solutions to halting the spread of Ebola and long-term ones to prevent future outbreaks. As a short-term strategy, vaccination could prove enormously useful in tackling the Ebola crisis in apes. Unlike for humans, a vaccine for gorillas and apes has been developed which thus far has been proven both safe and effective.\n\nTo date though, these trials have not involved \"challenging\" the vaccinated chimps with the live virus. Across much of Europe, medical research on great apes is either banned or highly restricted because of their cognitive similarity to humans. The question is whether or not we should make an exception in this case.\n\nIn the long term, conservation efforts aimed at restoring forest habitat could also help curb the spread of the virus, as larger forested areas would reduce the chances of infected animals coming into contact with one another. In tandem with forest regeneration, greater protection for apes from hunters and strict laws to control bushmeat consumption would also be hugely beneficial, both for apes and for humans.\n\nMeera Inglis is affiliated with the green party (England)"},"shares":{"facebook":194,"twitter":883,"google_plus":40,"stumble_upon":94,"total":1211},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAxLzI0L2FlL2Nyb3Nzcml2ZXJnLjk0NzkzLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/36eb919e/fc4/cross-river-gorilla.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAxLzI0L2FlL2Nyb3Nzcml2ZXJnLjk0NzkzLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/a73e9dc8/fc4/cross-river-gorilla.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAxLzI0L2FlL2Nyb3Nzcml2ZXJnLjk0NzkzLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTIwMHgxMTUjCmUJanBn/0a31a6ae/fc4/cross-river-gorilla.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzAxLzI0L2FlL2Nyb3Nzcml2ZXJnLjk0NzkzLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTQwMHgyMzAjCmUJanBn/07724474/fc4/cross-river-gorilla.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1CBoPGz","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"There is a side to the Ebola crisis that, perhaps understandably, has received little media attention: the threat it poses to our nearest cousins, the great apes of Africa.

A Kurdish official, who was convinced the cases are Ebola, told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants' symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus.\n\nHowever, Ebola symptoms -- nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising -- are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases, including malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever viruses and the Marburg virus. Also, most confirmed Ebola cases in this recent outbreak have originated in West Africa.\n\nCiting an unnamed source in a Mosul hospital, Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said the disease arrived in Mosul from \"terrorists\" who came \"from several countries\" and Africa. \n\nWhile ISIS has recruited foreign fighters, very few of them -- if any at all -- are believed to have traveled from West Africa.\n\nThe majority of the Islamic State's African fighters came from Tunisia, according to a Washington Post report. Others came from Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan and Somalia -- none of which reported any Ebola cases in 2014.\n\nIf the cases in Mosul turn out to be Ebola -- a scenario that, at this point, seems highly unlikely -- it would mark the first time the virus had been detected in an area controlled by ISIS, a group that doesn't embrace science and modern medicine.\n\nOver the past few weeks, militants affiliated with ISIS have executed more than a dozen doctors in Mosul, according to Benjamin T. Decker, an intelligence analyst with the Levantine Group, a Middle East-based geopolitical risk and research consultancy.\n\n\"U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,\" Decker, who specializes in Iraq, told Mashable.\n\n\"In this context,\" he said, \"the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?

But thousands of bats lived in the tree, and one toddler -- a 2-year-old named Emile Ouamouno -- may have contracted Ebola from playing there.\n\nEmile, who died in December 2013, was \"patient zero,\" or the first person known to have contracted Ebola in the current outbreak that has now claimed at least 7,600 lives in the region. In a new study, researchers looking for the source of the outbreak found that free-tailed bats (Mops condylurus) lived in the tree. These bats are likely a reservoir of the disease, the researchers concluded.\n\nThe tree was about 165 feet away from Emile's house, in the village of 31 houses surrounded by farmland.\n\n\"It [the tree] was near a path where the women would go for washing,\" said Fabian Leendertz, a veterinarian at the Robert Koch Institute in Germany who specializes in zoonotic diseases. \"They would always walk down there with the kids, and the kids would play in this nice tree.\" \n\nPerhaps Emile got Ebola from one of the bats in the tree, Leendertz told Live Science.\n\nThe researchers will never know for sure -- a fire in the tree on March 24 killed thousands of bats. A few days later, when Leendertz and his team arrived in the village, the villagers had already removed or eaten the dead bats, and there wasn't any evidence left to test for the Ebola virus, Leendertz said. However, the team did find DNA evidence that Mops condylurus were living there, he said.\n\nSEE ALSO: Where Did Ebola Come From?\r\nThe finding opens up the possibility that free-tailed bats, which eat insects, may carry and transmit Ebola, reports the study, published Dec. 30 in the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine. Other studies have found that the virus can live in fruit-eating and insect-eating bats, Leendertz said.\n\nLeendertz and his colleagues spent four weeks surveying the forest around Meliandou and interviewing villagers in the area. One theory is that Emile could have caught Ebola from a large mammal, such as a chimpanzee, but the researchers found no evidence of an Ebola outbreak in nearby animals.\n\n\"Animals, we can largely rule out,\" Leendertz said. \"In theory, there could have been a small hidden epidemic. We didn't monitor the entire forest, but we can for sure say there was no large epidemic among the large wildlife.\"\n\nMoreover, regional authorities, hunters and women in the village told the researchers that primates are rare in this region of southeastern Guinea, and the few that remain are difficult to hunt. Much of the large game eaten in the area arrives smoked from Liberia and northwestern Guinea, which makes it an unlikely source of the disease, the researchers said.\n\nIt is also possible to get Ebola from eating improperly cooked bat meat or by coming in contact with infected bodily fluids from a bat -- and villagers in Meliandou routinely hunt bats for food. The researchers captured 169 bats in the area and tested them for Ebola, but none of the tests came back positive, Leendertz said. However, a foodborne transmission of Ebola likely would have affected adults in the community before or at the same time it affected Emile, the researchers said. This suggests a source of infection unrelated to food.\n\nMany of the children in the village caught and played with bats in the hollow tree, and it remains possible that Emile caught Ebola there, Leendertz said.\n\n\"People have said, 'How can you be sure that the boy played in the tree?'\" Leendertz said. \"But how likely is it that a kid would not play in a playground next to his house? We talked a lot to the other children, and found out that they are actually quite big bat hunters.\"\n\nIt's not clear how the tree caught fire, but it burned down soon after the Guinea government banned the eating and hunting of bats, Leendertz said. He stressed that bats play an important role in the region's ecosystem: Fruit bats pollinate flowers and spread seeds, and insectivorous bats eat mosquitoes and help prevent the spread of malaria.\n\n\"We have to learn to live with these animals like we live with rabies in bats in Germany and Europe,\" he said. \"It's not a solution to start killing bats and chasing away the colonies.\""},"shares":{"twitter":1136,"facebook":66,"google_plus":50,"total":1252},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzMxL2M5L01leGljYW5mcmVlLjc1OWYzLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/f6aebc3d/504/Mexican-free-tailed-bats.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzMxL2M5L01leGljYW5mcmVlLjc1OWYzLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/5c807fe8/504/Mexican-free-tailed-bats.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzMxL2M5L01leGljYW5mcmVlLjc1OWYzLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTIwMHgxMTUjCmUJanBn/2948e8c4/504/Mexican-free-tailed-bats.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEyLzMxL2M5L01leGljYW5mcmVlLjc1OWYzLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTQwMHgyMzAjCmUJanBn/f9a9da44/504/Mexican-free-tailed-bats.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/174K87b","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"In the small village of Meliandou, in Guinea, stood a tall, hollowed-out tree where children loved to play.

As an associate public health nurse at Blantyre Health Centre in South Lanarkshire, she was part of a group of 50 National Health Service (NHS) health care workers who returned to the UK over the weekend after volunteering in Sierra Leone. \n\nShe had been working in Lakka, outside the capital of Freetown, with Save the Children since Nov. 23. \n\nIn November, Cafferkey told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that she had applied to go to Sierra Leone; she couldn't think of a reason not to go. However, she said she was not complacent about the risks and had undergone nine days of training with the Ministry of Defence before being dispatched.  \n\nIn the diary published in The Scotsman, Cafferkey described the moments after she stepped off the plane in Sierra Leone: the smell of chlorine, a thermometer pointed at her head. \n\n\"We are very well catered for and are housed in a wee shack on the beach. It has electricity for a few hours during the night and although mostly cold has running water,\" she wrote. \"This is basic stuff but I\u2019m not here for a holiday. Being coastal we are very fortunate to get to walk along a beautiful beach every day to get to the hotel that serves our food.\"\n\nWhile the location may be quite beautiful, Cafferkey wrote, she described a bleak picture for the patients she was treating:\n\nHad an awful shift this week. I was with a lady who was dying. I could tell she didn\u2019t have long, so I was trying to make her comfortable. There was a young boy standing at the window looking in and I waved to him. A few minutes later she had passed away and I heard the boy crying outside the ward. When I went to him, he asked if she had died. I said yes. He said she was his mother. He had already lost his father to Ebola, and now he had no parents.\n\nShe described the protective measures she and her colleagues took while administering care to patients, worrying that health workers looked like aliens in their suits. \n\n\"The PPE [personal protective equipment] alien-type suit that I have to wear when going into the positive Red Zone is horrendous. It takes about 20 minutes to dress and 15 minutes to take the suit off at the other end,\" Cafferkey wrote. \n\n\"They would certainly be beneficial on a cold winter\u2019s night in Scotland but working in them in 30 degree heat is uncomfortable to say the least. On the up side, I feel very well protected.\"\n\nCafferkey arrived at the Royal Free Hospital in North London on Tuesday after she was flown in a military plane from Glasgow. She had returned to Scotland from Sierra Leone via Casablanca and London Heathrow, arriving at around 11:30 p.m. on Sunday. A telephone helpline has been set up for anyone travelling on those flights at 08000 858531.\n\nIn her final diary entry from her fourth week in Sierra Leone, Cafferkey wrote about Christmas and New Year's gatherings being cancelled there. She also wrote about the knock-on impact the virus had on the country's economy and school system. \n\nShe added that the spirits of the aid workers are buoyed by the number of Ebola patients who have recovered and are being discharged.\n\n\"When they are able to clear Ebola and are strong enough for discharge, the patients will go to the 'happy shower' to have their last chlorine wash, and leave all their personal belongings for incineration and collect new clothes,\" she wrote. \n\n\"It helps us remember the good work we are doing and the reason we are all here.\"\n\n Have something to add to this story?
