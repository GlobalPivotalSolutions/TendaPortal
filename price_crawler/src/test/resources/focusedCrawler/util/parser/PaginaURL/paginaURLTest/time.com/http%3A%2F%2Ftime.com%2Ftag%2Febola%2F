			<div class="video-content"><p>The news sounds familiar: a virus with no treatment or cure is spreading abroad. But while Ebola dominated the infectious disease news over the last year, the latest infection making headlines is the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which has most recently hit South Korea, infecting 87 there and killing 6.</p>
<p>Could the two viruses cause similar damage?</p>

<p>Currently, MERS doesn&#8217;t appear to be able to spread like Ebola can. Though it&#8217;s in the same family of viruses as SARS and the common cold&mdash;both highly contagious&mdash;MERS appears to be less transmittable. While Ebola spreads through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, MERS doesn&#8217;t spread easily from person to person, and though it spreads through the respiratory tract, very close contact is needed, which is why the risk is higher for health care workers.</p>
<p class="p1"><div id="mers_graph" class="time-interactive"><img src="http://content.time.com/time/wp/interactives/apps/mers_graph/screenshot.png" class="screenshot" style="width:100%;"></div></p>
<p>Both diseases have high fatality rates (around 3 to 4 of every 10 patients reported with MERS have died) and like Ebola, there is no vaccine or cure for MERS. But right now, MERS is more of a mystery to the medical community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ebola has been around for 40 years so we have a pretty good sense of how it functions and its genome has been pretty stable,&#8221; says Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). &#8220;MERS emerged in 2012 and we are still learning about it, and it may still be learning about us and evolving. It&rsquo;s believed that when SARS spent more time circulating among humans, it evolved and became more transmissible.&#8221; Frieden says they haven&#8217;t yet seen that in MERS, but they&#8217;re watching: the CDC is currently sequencing the genome of the virus to understand how it might be changing, and to track its course.</p>
<p>The chance that MERS could change to become more transmittable worries experts. &#8220;Personally, I am more concerned about MERS following the course of SARS than I ever will be regarding Ebola becoming widespread outside of certain regions of Africa,&#8221; says Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior associate at the Center for Health Security at the University of Pittsburgh.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3910571"></div>
<p><strong>MORE </strong><a href="http://time.com/97732/what-is-mers-what-you-need-to-know/?iid=time_speed">What Is MERS? Here&rsquo;s What You Need To Know</a></p>
<p>MERS has yet to take that course, Frieden says, but hospitals can be hotbeds for the infection. Through intensive investigations in affected countries, the CDC has determined that more than 90% of the cases could be traced health care exposures. So far there hasn&#8217;t been evidence of sustained community spreading. &#8220;Hospitals can become amplification points,&#8221; says Frieden. &#8220;It&rsquo;s the case in measles, it&rsquo;s the case for drug-resistant tuberculosis, it&rsquo;s the case for MERS and SARS and Ebola. That&rsquo;s where sick people go and that&rsquo;s where vulnerable people are. It really emphasizes the importance of good infection control in the health care system.&#8221;</p>
<p>In May of 2014, the U.S. experienced two cases of MERS. In both instances, the patients were health care providers who lived and worked in the Middle East. Health departments around the U.S. have the ability to test for the virus, and the U.S. has already tested around 550 people in 45 states as a precaution since the disease first emerged in 2012.</p>
<p>MERS and Ebola share an important similarity: a lack of treatments or vaccinations. There&#8217;s currently no vaccine. &#8220;If there were a vaccine, it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that might be useful in the camel population, but that&rsquo;s very theoretical for the future,&#8221; Frieden says.</p>
<p>Only 20% of countries are currently able to rapidly detect, respond to or prevent global health threats from emerging infections, like MERS and Ebola, according to CDC data. Countries around the world and official health emergency responders like the World Health Organization have vowed to increase their ability to act during outbreaks that public health experts say are undeniably in our future. Frieden says the CDC in partnership with other countries is accelerating its <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/healthprotection/ghs/index.htm">Global Health Security program</a>, which will increase preparedness worldwide. The CDC is making visits to eight countries in the next six weeks to move the program forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bottom line, both Ebola and MERS are emerging infections that show us why it&rsquo;s so important for every country in the world to be prepared to find and stop health threats when and where they emerge,&#8221; Frieden says. &#8220;We do think the South Korea outbreak will well grow, but there&rsquo;s no reason to think it can&rsquo;t be controlled as other outbreaks have been controlled.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In the next 20 years, is it likely that nuclear war, gigantic earthquakes or asteroids could <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/5/27/8660249/gates-flu-pandemic" target="_blank">kill</a> 20 million people? Bill Gates doesn&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>But he did tell <em>Vox</em> that such numbers could be felled by a major outbreak of disease &mdash; something the 59-year-old billionaire believes has a &#8220;well over 50%&#8221; chance of happening in his lifetime.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Ebola epidemic showed me that we&#8217;re not ready for a serious epidemic, an epidemic that would be more infectious and would spread faster than Ebola did. This is the greatest risk of a huge tragedy,&#8221; Gates said, claiming that a serious epidemic could kill more than 10 million people a year.</p>

		<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">A new study suggests there was a better way to respond to the Ebola outbreak</h2>
		<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>It&rsquo;s known that the response to the most recent Ebola outbreak, which as of Tuesday had infected more than 27,000 people and killed 11,130, was far too slow. Now, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07020" target="_blank">a new study</a> suggests that even once they got started, their approach to curbing the spread wasn&rsquo;t the most efficient or effective.</p>
<p>One of the staples of infectious disease outbreak responses was contact tracing: finding everyone who comes in direct contact with a sick person. And it makes sense that health authorities would employ that in this outbreak, since it&rsquo;s proven in the past to be an effective way to contain the spread of a virus. However, experts at the New England Complex Systems Institute <a href="http://necsi.edu/research/social/pandemics/beyondcontact.html" target="_blank">released new research</a> Tuesday that argues contact tracing wasn&rsquo;t the best approach.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Yaneer Bar-Yam, founding president of the Institute, and his colleagues conducted in-depth mathematical simulations that found that a community-wide response that monitors entire groups of people&mdash;rather than tracking down individuals who may or may not have been exposed to the virus via an infected person they had contact with&mdash;could have been more efficient.</p>
<p>In the simulations, the researchers accounted for a wide variety of factors and ultimately concluded that a response that focused on community-wide monitoring&mdash;for instance, going door-to-door to check on people in a given area as well implementing travel restrictions&mdash;would have been more effective than tracking down contacts of infected people one by one. The objective of a community response, they write, is to progressively limit the disease to smaller and smaller geographical areas, while simultaneously sending in resources.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&ldquo;You treat the whole community as if it might have been in contact with someone,&rdquo; says Bar-Yam. &ldquo;Trying to figure out who [an infected person] was in contact with doesn&rsquo;t make as much sense&mdash;and it&rsquo;s not as cost effective as saying, &lsquo;Well, everyone may have been in contact with these people, so we better check all of them.'&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the most telling parts of Bar-Yam&rsquo;s study was when the researchers looked at what happens when people do <em>not</em> comply with the health guidelines that are put in place to curb an outbreak. After all, no matter how many times people are told what to do, it&rsquo;s hard to persuade them to stay away from public areas, for instance, or to avoid travel to at-risk places. They found that community-wide monitoring is successful at ending the outbreak even if there&rsquo;s only 40% compliance.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3892513"></div>
<p>&ldquo;You will save more lives if you have higher conformity,&rdquo; says Bar-Yam of community monitoring, adding that, &ldquo;from the macro picture you&rsquo;re stopping the epidemic very rapidly.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>The Key to Liberia Being Ebola Free?</h4>
<p>In mid-September 2014 in Liberia, cases of Ebola started to drop significantly. It&rsquo;s unclear why, but the authors note that around that time, a community-wide approach to stopping the spread of Ebola was taken in Liberia.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6418a5.htm?s_cid=mm6418a5_w" target="_blank">published a report</a> on how it controlled the final cluster, and noted that the response included community-based approaches. And in a report on how Liberia got to zero cases, <a href="http://www.who.int/features/2015/liberia-ends-ebola/en/" target="_blank">the WHO writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the first signs that the outbreak might be turned around appeared in September 2014, when cases in Lofa county, Ebola&rsquo;s initial epicentre, began to decline after a peak of more than 150 cases a week in mid-August. Epidemiologists would later link that decline to a package of interventions, with community engagement playing a critical role.</p>
<p>In Lofa, staff from the WHO country office moved from village to village, challenging chiefs and religious leaders to take charge of the response. Community task forces were formed to create house-to-house awareness, report suspected cases, call health teams for support, and conduct contact tracing.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how difficult it would have been to implement it earlier,&rdquo; says Bar-Yam. &ldquo;Everyone kept saying, &lsquo;Contact tracing is the tried-and-true right way to do this.'&rdquo; Indeed, since contact tracing has been shown in numerous outbreaks in the past to be effective means of disease containment, that was the de facto strategy in west Africa during this Ebola outbreak.</p>
<p>This study alone cannot prove that health authorities and volunteers were misguided in their use of contact tracing.</p>
<h4>Is It Either/Or?</h4>
<p>The CDC declined to comment about the paper specifically, but spoke to TIME about the agency&rsquo;s use of contact tracing and community monitoring. &ldquo;When you are able to understand the connections [between people], while imperfect, you understand who is most likely to be infected and you are able to follow them,&rdquo; says Jonathan Yoder, an epidemiologist with the CDC who responded to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. &ldquo;At the end, it was really important that nothing was missed. One contact can start a whole other outbreak. I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s one or the other. I think the approach of engaging communities is really important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bar-Yam says his work shows that there is an alternative approach to contact tracing alone, and that it appears to work&mdash;possibly more quickly than contact tracing, if done early enough.</p>
<p>The paper also underlines the importance of being nimble when it comes to dealing with outbreaks of infectious diseases like Ebola. &ldquo;Everyone thinks in terms of statistics of prior events. Everyone looks at prior history and says &lsquo;What are we going to be able to expect in the future based on what happened in the past?&rsquo;&rdquo; says Bar-Yam.</p></body></html>

		<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">He had recently returned from traveling in Liberia</h2>
		<p>A man died of a rare African virus in New Jersey Monday after recently returning from Liberia, officials <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0525-lassa.html" target="_blank">confirmed. </a></p>
<p>The man died of Lassa fever, a virus that causes hemorrhagic symptoms but is very different from Ebola, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Lassa fever is only fatal for 1% of those who are infected, while Ebola can be fatal for 70% of those infected without treatment. Lassa fever is also much harder to spread from person to person (it&#8217;s usually picked up from rodent droppings). About 100,000 to 300,000 Lassa fever cases are reported in West Africa every year, resulting in about 5,000 deaths.</p>
<p>The man with Lassa fever had arrived at JFK airport from Liberia on May 17, and went to a hospital the following day complaining of fever, sore throat and tiredness, officials said. At that time, he did not say he had been traveling in West Africa, and he was sent home the same day. On May 21 his symptoms worsened and he returned to the hospital, at which point he was transferred to a facility equipped to deal with viral hemorrhagic fevers. The patient was in &#8220;appropriate isolation&#8221; when he died Monday evening. The CDC is working to compile a list of people who may have encountered the patient while he was sick, and they are monitoring close contacts for 21 days to see if they develop the virus.</p>

		<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">The agency is establishing a $100 million contingency fund</h2>
		<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is implementing &#8220;fundamental changes&#8221;&mdash;including a establishing a $100 million contingency fund&mdash;after the poor response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world was ill-prepared to respond to an outbreak that was so widespread, so severe, so sustained, and so complex,&#8221; said WHO Director-General, Dr. Margaret Chan at the annual World Health Assembly on Monday.&#8221;WHO was overwhelmed, as were all other responders. The demands on WHO were more than ten times greater than ever experienced in the almost 70-year history of this Organization.&#8221; The assembly is the decision-making body of WHO and the meeting is attended by delegates from the WHO member states.</p>
<div class="video-wrapper brightcove-size-large" data-pos="6" data-continuous="1" data-playlist="0"><object id="bc-video-3933076472001-6" class="BrightcoveExperience"><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"><param name="width" value="100%"><param name="height" value="100%"><param name="playerID" value="1847503743001"><param name="isVid" value="true"><param name="isUI" value="true"><param name="dynamicStreaming" value="true"><param name="videoSmoothing" value="true"><param name="linkBaseURL" value="http://ti.me/1LdEsX2"><param name="includeAPI" value="true"><param name="templateLoadHandler" value="Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad"><param name="templateReadyHandler" value="Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady"><param name="wmode" value="opaque"><param name="htmlFallback" value="true"><param name="@videoPlayer" value="3933076472001"></object></div>
<p>Chan told those present at the event that the WHO is making changes to ensure it is better equipped for a similar health-related emergency in the future.</p>
<p>First, the WHO says it is developing a new program specifically focusing on health emergencies that will have performance benchmarks for what must happen 24, 48 and 72 hours after the beginning of an outbreak. The WHO is also establishing a global health emergency workforce and will strengthen its trained emergency response staff through a proposed increase in budget. The agency is also streamlining its managerial and logistical procedures. Lastly, Chan said the agency is establishing a $100 million contingency fund that will be financed through voluntary contributions. This, Chan said, is to make sure the WHO has the necessary resources needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not ever again want to see this Organization faced with a situation it is not prepared, staffed, funded, or administratively set up to manage,&#8221; said Chan. &#8220;We will move forward on an urgent footing. I plan to complete these changes by the end of the year.&#8221;</p>

		<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">The patient was a healthcare worker volunteering in Sierra Leone</h2>
		<p>A healthcare worker in Italy has been diagnosed with Ebola, the first time a person has received an Ebola diagnosis in the country. The patient is currently undergoing treatment for the disease.</p>
<p>The worker was volunteering in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone, and on May 7, the volunteer flew from Freetown, Sierra Leone to Rome, stopping in Casablanca, Morocco. The patient had no symptoms at that time. It wasn&#8217;t until May 10, when the patient was already in Italy, that they began to experience symptoms of the virus. <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/13-may-2015-ebola/en/" target="_blank">The World Health Organization (WHO) reports</a> that the patient isolated themselves in their home before they were transported on the May 11 to the Hospital of Sassari, Sardinia. On May 12th, samples from the patient confirmed that they did indeed have Ebola.</p>
<p>The patient was then transferred from the Hospital of Sassari to he National Institute for Infectious Diseases (INMI) Lazzaro Spallanzani of Rome in a special aircraft.</p>
<p>Since the patient did not start experiencing symptoms until 72 hours after returning to Italy, WHO says it is not necessary to conduct contact tracing of individuals who were on the same plane. Ebola can only be transmitted via the bodily fluids of a symptomatic person.</p>
<p>More than 26,720 cases of Ebola have been reported in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea since the start of the outbreak, and more than 11,000 people have died.</p>

		<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">"The most important thing we do is enter into the suffering of others"</h2>
			<span class="read-video-article collapsed">+ READ ARTICLE</span>
			<div class="video-content"><p>Dr. Kent Brantly, one of the Americans who contracted Ebola while treating patients in Liberia, <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/05/09/ebola-doctor-kent-brantly-iu-med-grads-stay-help/27057889/" target="_blank">told</a> graduates of the Indiana University School of Medicine on Saturday that failure isn&#8217;t the focus of being a physician.</p>
<p>Brantly, among the &#8220;Ebola Fighters&#8221; honored as <a href="http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-ebola-fighters-choice/" target="_blank">TIME&#8217;s Person of the Year</a>, recalled his experience treating&mdash;and losing&mdash;patients as a missionary doctor in Liberia, the Indianapolis <em>Star </em>reports. After he contracted Ebola last summer, he was transferred to the U.S. for care and later declared virus-free.</p>
<p>&#8220;Losing so many patients certainly was difficult, but it didn&#8217;t make me feel like a failure as a physician,&#8221; the Indianapolis native said at the commencement ceremony, &#8220;because I had learned that there was so much more to being a physician than curing illness. That&#8217;s not the most important thing we do. The most important thing we do is enter into the suffering of others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to hold the hands of people as they died, to offer dignity in the face of humiliating circumstances,&#8221; Brantly said. &#8220;You are going to share in the most intimate parts of your patients&#8217; lives. You will share in their moments of tragedy. But you will also share in their moments of greatest joy. You will make a difference in people&#8217;s lives, and you will make a difference in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brantly, a graduate of the same medical school, also proudly shared the news that the World Health Organization, earlier in the day, had <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2015/liberia-ends-ebola/en/" target="_blank">declared</a> an end to the Ebola outbreak in Liberia.</p>

		<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">His blood was declared Ebola-free, but the virus remained in an eye</h2>
		<p>Ebola may stick around longer in survivors than researchers previously believed, and it may even cause eyes to change color, according to a case study <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/health/weeks-after-his-recovery-ebola-lurked-in-a-doctors-eye.html" target="_blank">released</a> Thursday.</p>
<p>Dr. Ian Crozier, who contracted the virus while working as a World Health Organization volunteer at a treatment center in Kenema, Sierra Leone, underwent an intensive struggle with the disease after being transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Less than two months after he was released in October, the New York <em>Times</em> reports, based on the <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1500306?query=featured_home#t=article" target="_blank">study</a> in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, Dr. Crozier was experiencing vision issues and pain in his left eye. Test results would later show that although Crozier&#8217;s blood had been declared Ebola-free, his eye was still full of the virus. Not only that, but the iris turned from blue to green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It felt almost personal that the virus could be in my eye without me knowing it,&rdquo; he said, adding that the color change felt &#8220;like an assault.&#8221; Dr. Crozier&#8217;s sight and eye color later returned, mystifying doctors who had been helping treat his eye inflammation called uveitis, but his case shows researchers there is still much to learn about the deadly virus.</p>

		<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">The actress discusses her Ebola documentary, "Body Team 12" </h2>
		<p><strong>Correction appended, April 23</strong></p>
<p>Olivia Wilde may be best known for her work onscreen in the likes of <em>House </em>and <em>Tron: Legacy</em>. But she&#8217;s increasingly getting more involved behind the camera, most recently in producing the documentary short <em>Body Team 12</em>.</p>
<p>The film, which screened at the Tribeca Film Festival and has a planned release in the fall, is directed by aid worker David Darg. It depicts the work a Liberian woman named Garmai Sumo, whose work hauling the bodies of the dead during the Ebola crisis is both arduous and emotionally taxing. In the time since, Sumo has moved from burying the dead to feeding the living and is involved in aiding the orphans of Monrovia through her <a href="http://www.EbolaOrphanProject.com" target="_blank">Ebola Orphan Project</a>. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a wonderful tale of redemption for Garmai,&#8221; Darg says.</p>
<p>The film upsets and overwhelms with scenes of Sumo facing angry families even as she places herself at grave risk, but the film provides viewers uplift in the form of a fairly direct way to support Sumo&#8217;s work today. It emerged from Darg&#8217;s aid work in Liberia; he embedded with a body team along with journalists from the <em>Washington Post </em>and China&#8217;s CCTV. Wilde came in at a later stage of production; Darg and producer Bryn Mooser &#8220;approached me about coming on as an executive producer, and I wanted to help in any way I could to facilitate the process and help people see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a role with which Wilde has grown more and more comfortable. The actress joined Twitter in an attempt to raise money after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. &#8220;That&rsquo;s ancient history now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I&rsquo;ve embraced it for both valuable causes and complete bulls&#8212;.&#8221;</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3831388"></div>
<p>Wilde, who in recent bookings on TV has brought Darg and Mooser along to speak authoritatively about Ebola, is on the forefront of celebrities who&#8217;ve embraced the power of celebrity to draw attention to causes, even if it erodes mystique.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of celebrities are coming around to the idea that Twitter and the Internet in all ways is not necessarily as representative of defeat as it was once seen,&#8221; she says. &#8220;When Twitter started, I think a lot of celebrities thought, &#8216;This is the ultimate betrayal of privacy, blah blah blah&#8217;&mdash;that it would ruin all sense of separation between people and celebrities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, though, stars who use social media to promote causes are widely lauded, a change that Wilde pegs to broader societal indulgence of a life online. &#8220;It used to be very separated, and there was this sense of maintaining the illusion, and that an actor had to be anonymous so people would believe you in character. But I think the nature of society has changed and it&rsquo;s happened for everyone, not just celebrities. People share more, and people expect to be shared with. There&rsquo;s just a sense of acceptance of a more complex and dynamic life, a more varied personality.&#8221;</p>
<p>The one risk, perhaps, is Wilde&#8217;s believability as an actress given how out-front she is as a public persona. She&#8217;s unbothered: &#8220;Maybe there&rsquo;s someone who won&rsquo;t buy me because they&rsquo;ve seen me speaking about Ebola on the <i>Today </i>show. Who knows? But that would seem very rigid to me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Correction</b>: The original version of this story incorrectly described David Darg, who directed <i>Body Team 12</i>. He is an aid worker.</p>

Though it&#8217;s in the same family of viruses as SARS and the common cold&mdash;both highly contagious&mdash;MERS appears to be less transmittable. While Ebola spreads through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, MERS doesn&#8217;t spread easily from person to person, and though it spreads through the respiratory tract, very close contact is needed, which is why the risk is higher for health care workers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"mers_graph\" class=\"time-interactive\"><img src=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/wp\/interactives\/apps\/mers_graph\/screenshot.png\" class=\"screenshot\" style=\"width:100%;\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Both diseases have high fatality rates (around 3 to 4 of every 10 patients reported with MERS have died) and like Ebola, there is no vaccine or cure for MERS. But right now, MERS is more of a mystery to the medical community.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Ebola has been around for 40 years so we have a pretty good sense of how it functions and its genome has been pretty stable,&#8221; says Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). &#8220;MERS emerged in 2012 and we are still learning about it, and it may still be learning about us and evolving. It&rsquo;s believed that when SARS spent more time circulating among humans, it evolved and became more transmissible.&#8221; Frieden says they haven&#8217;t yet seen that in MERS, but they&#8217;re watching: the CDC is currently sequencing the genome of the virus to understand how it might be changing, and to track its course.<\/p>\n<p>The chance that MERS could change to become more transmittable worries experts. &#8220;Personally, I am more concerned about MERS following the course of SARS than I ever will be regarding Ebola becoming widespread outside of certain regions of Africa,&#8221; says Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior associate at the Center for Health Security at the University of Pittsburgh.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3910571\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>MORE <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/97732\/what-is-mers-what-you-need-to-know\/?iid=time_speed\">What Is MERS? Here&rsquo;s What You Need To Know<\/a><\/p>\n<p>MERS has yet to take that course, Frieden says, but hospitals can be hotbeds for the infection. Through intensive investigations in affected countries, the CDC has determined that more than 90% of the cases could be traced health care exposures. So far there hasn&#8217;t been evidence of sustained community spreading. &#8220;Hospitals can become amplification points,&#8221; says Frieden. &#8220;It&rsquo;s the case in measles, it&rsquo;s the case for drug-resistant tuberculosis, it&rsquo;s the case for MERS and SARS and Ebola. That&rsquo;s where sick people go and that&rsquo;s where vulnerable people are. It really emphasizes the importance of good infection control in the health care system.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In May of 2014, the U.S. experienced two cases of MERS. In both instances, the patients were health care providers who lived and worked in the Middle East. Health departments around the U.S. have the ability to test for the virus, and the U.S. has already tested around 550 people in 45 states as a precaution since the disease first emerged in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>MERS and Ebola share an important similarity: a lack of treatments or vaccinations. There&#8217;s currently no vaccine. &#8220;If there were a vaccine, it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that might be useful in the camel population, but that&rsquo;s very theoretical for the future,&#8221; Frieden says.<\/p>\n<p>Only 20% of countries are currently able to rapidly detect, respond to or prevent global health threats from emerging infections, like MERS and Ebola, according to CDC data. Countries around the world and official health emergency responders like the World Health Organization have vowed to increase their ability to act during outbreaks that public health experts say are undeniably in our future. Frieden says the CDC in partnership with other countries is accelerating its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/globalhealth\/healthprotection\/ghs\/index.htm\">Global Health Security program<\/a>, which will increase preparedness worldwide. The CDC is making visits to eight countries in the next six weeks to move the program forward.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Bottom line, both Ebola and MERS are emerging infections that show us why it&rsquo;s so important for every country in the world to be prepared to find and stop health threats when and where they emerge,&#8221; Frieden says. &#8220;We do think the South Korea outbreak will well grow, but there&rsquo;s no reason to think it can&rsquo;t be controlled as other outbreaks have been controlled.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>Read next: <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3912167\/mers-south-korea-sixth-death-23-affected-teenager\/?iid=time_readnext\">6 Dead, 87 Infected, 2,300 Quarantined: South Korea&rsquo;s MERS Crisis<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/newsletter\/the-brief\/autoplay\/?xid=spl-fullbrief-article\">Listen to the most important stories of the day.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3627480\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Health","slug":"health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/health\/","description":"The latest health news, trends, and commentary from TIME, covering medicine, mental health, diet, fitness, sex, aging, disease, healthcare, policy and more","health":true},"tag":{"name":"public health","slug":"public-health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/public-health\/"},"tags":"CDC|ebola|Frieden|Infectious Disease|MERS|public health|South Korea|What is MERS","id":3910571,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3910571%2Fmers-ebola%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1KQDkew","encoded_title":"Here%E2%80%99s+the+Difference+Between+MERS+and+Ebola","galleries":[{"id":3627480,"slug":"time-person-of-the-year-behind-the-photos","title":"Photographing TIME's Person of the Year in Africa, Europe and the U.S.","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3627480\/time-person-of-the-year-behind-the-photos\/","type":"normal","hidecount":false,"fullscreen":true,"counterfullscreen":true,"adfrequency":0,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3627480%2Ftime-person-of-the-year-behind-the-photos%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1y0OjrN","encoded_title":"Photographing+TIME%27s+Person+of+the+Year+in+Africa%2C+Europe+and+the+U.S.","twitter_via":"TIMEHealth","email_title":"Photographing%20TIME%27s%20Person%20of%20the%20Year%20in%20Africa%2C%20Europe%20and%20the%20U.S.","hasAds":true,"twitter_text":"This%20is%20what%20it%20was%20like%20to%20photograph%20%23TIMEPOY%20in%20Africa%2C%20Europe%20and%20the%20U.S.","fb_text":"This%20is%20what%20it%20was%20like%20to%20photograph%20%23TIMEPOY%20in%20Africa%2C%20Europe%20and%20the%20U.S.","email_body":"Sworn%20to%20secrecy%2C%20photographers%20Jackie%20Nickerson%20and%20Bryan%20Schutmaat%20were%20on%20the%20assignment%20of%20a%20lifetime%20when%20TIME%20asked%20them%20to%20photograph%20the%202014%20Person%20of%20the%20Year%20--%20the%20Ebola%20Fighters","size":"default","galleries":[{"id":3916518,"title":"Besieged by ISIS: Photographs From Inside the Syrian City of Deir ez-Zor","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/syrian_contact_12.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3916518\/isis-syria-photographs\/"},{"id":3915227,"title":"See Photographer Burk Uzzle's Beautiful Chaos","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/burk_uzzle_bu136.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3915227\/see-photographer-burk-uzzles-beautiful-chaos\/"},{"id":3906051,"title":"Baltimore Photographer Devin Allen Tells His City's Story in Pictures","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/devin-allen-baltimore-10.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3906051\/baltimore-devin-allen\/"},{"id":3912867,"title":"Vincent Musi: The Art of Photographing Animals","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/vincent-musi-animals-look3-06.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3912867\/vincent-musi-the-art-of-photographing-animals\/"},{"id":3912383,"title":"Looking for the Joy of Sports Through Walter Iooss' Photographs","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/walteriooss-03-2.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3912383\/looking-for-the-joy-of-sports-through-walter-iooss-photographs\/"},{"id":3912821,"title":"Meet the Photographer Who Created a 3D Miniature Version of Himself","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/chris-buck-3d-instagram-09.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3912821\/photographer-figurine-chris-buck\/"}],"photos":[{"id":3627485,"title":"time-person-of-the-year-2014-behind-the-photos-edit-01","slug":"time-person-of-the-year-2014-behind-the-photos-edit-01","caption":"Foday Galla, 37, Ambulance Supervisor, photographed at home wearing a PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) suit, in Signboard community, in Monrovia, Liberia.

Now, <a href=\"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1505.07020\" target=\"_blank\">a new study<\/a> suggests that even once they got started, their approach to curbing the spread wasn&rsquo;t the most efficient or effective.<\/p>\n<p>One of the staples of infectious disease outbreak responses was contact tracing: finding everyone who comes in direct contact with a sick person. And it makes sense that health authorities would employ that in this outbreak, since it&rsquo;s proven in the past to be an effective way to contain the spread of a virus. However, experts at the New England Complex Systems Institute <a href=\"http:\/\/necsi.edu\/research\/social\/pandemics\/beyondcontact.html\" target=\"_blank\">released new research<\/a> Tuesday that argues contact tracing wasn&rsquo;t the best approach.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Yaneer Bar-Yam, founding president of the Institute, and his colleagues conducted in-depth mathematical simulations that found that a community-wide response that monitors entire groups of people&mdash;rather than tracking down individuals who may or may not have been exposed to the virus via an infected person they had contact with&mdash;could have been more efficient.<\/p>\n<p>In the simulations, the researchers accounted for a wide variety of factors and ultimately concluded that a response that focused on community-wide monitoring&mdash;for instance, going door-to-door to check on people in a given area as well implementing travel restrictions&mdash;would have been more effective than tracking down contacts of infected people one by one. The objective of a community response, they write, is to progressively limit the disease to smaller and smaller geographical areas, while simultaneously sending in resources.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&ldquo;You treat the whole community as if it might have been in contact with someone,&rdquo; says Bar-Yam. &ldquo;Trying to figure out who [an infected person] was in contact with doesn&rsquo;t make as much sense&mdash;and it&rsquo;s not as cost effective as saying, &lsquo;Well, everyone may have been in contact with these people, so we better check all of them.'&rdquo;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>One of the most telling parts of Bar-Yam&rsquo;s study was when the researchers looked at what happens when people do <em>not<\/em> comply with the health guidelines that are put in place to curb an outbreak. After all, no matter how many times people are told what to do, it&rsquo;s hard to persuade them to stay away from public areas, for instance, or to avoid travel to at-risk places. They found that community-wide monitoring is successful at ending the outbreak even if there&rsquo;s only 40% compliance.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3892513\"><\/div>\n<p>&ldquo;You will save more lives if you have higher conformity,&rdquo; says Bar-Yam of community monitoring, adding that, &ldquo;from the macro picture you&rsquo;re stopping the epidemic very rapidly.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignright\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/graphic.png?w=560&#038;h=450\" alt=\"\" height=\"450\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >NECSI<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h4>The Key to Liberia Being Ebola Free?<\/h4>\n<p>In mid-September 2014 in Liberia, cases of Ebola started to drop significantly. It&rsquo;s unclear why, but the authors note that around that time, a community-wide approach to stopping the spread of Ebola was taken in Liberia.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/preview\/mmwrhtml\/mm6418a5.htm?s_cid=mm6418a5_w\" target=\"_blank\">published a report<\/a> on how it controlled the final cluster, and noted that the response included community-based approaches. And in a report on how Liberia got to zero cases, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.who.int\/features\/2015\/liberia-ends-ebola\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\">the WHO writes<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the first signs that the outbreak might be turned around appeared in September 2014, when cases in Lofa county, Ebola&rsquo;s initial epicentre, began to decline after a peak of more than 150 cases a week in mid-August. Epidemiologists would later link that decline to a package of interventions, with community engagement playing a critical role.<\/p>\n<p>In Lofa, staff from the WHO country office moved from village to village, challenging chiefs and religious leaders to take charge of the response. Community task forces were formed to create house-to-house awareness, report suspected cases, call health teams for support, and conduct contact tracing.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how difficult it would have been to implement it earlier,&rdquo; says Bar-Yam. &ldquo;Everyone kept saying, &lsquo;Contact tracing is the tried-and-true right way to do this.'&rdquo; Indeed, since contact tracing has been shown in numerous outbreaks in the past to be effective means of disease containment, that was the de facto strategy in west Africa during this Ebola outbreak.<\/p>\n<p>This study alone cannot prove that health authorities and volunteers were misguided in their use of contact tracing.<\/p>\n<h4>Is It Either\/Or?<\/h4>\n<p>The CDC declined to comment about the paper specifically, but spoke to TIME about the agency&rsquo;s use of contact tracing and community monitoring. &ldquo;When you are able to understand the connections [between people], while imperfect, you understand who is most likely to be infected and you are able to follow them,&rdquo; says Jonathan Yoder, an epidemiologist with the CDC who responded to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. &ldquo;At the end, it was really important that nothing was missed. One contact can start a whole other outbreak. I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s one or the other. I think the approach of engaging communities is really important.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Bar-Yam says his work shows that there is an alternative approach to contact tracing alone, and that it appears to work&mdash;possibly more quickly than contact tracing, if done early enough.<\/p>\n<p>The paper also underlines the importance of being nimble when it comes to dealing with outbreaks of infectious diseases like Ebola. &ldquo;Everyone thinks in terms of statistics of prior events. Everyone looks at prior history and says &lsquo;What are we going to be able to expect in the future based on what happened in the past?&rsquo;&rdquo; says Bar-Yam.<\/p><\/body><\/html>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Health","slug":"health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/health\/","description":"The latest health news, trends, and commentary from

man died of a rare African virus in New Jersey Monday after recently returning from Liberia, officials <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/media\/releases\/2015\/p0525-lassa.html\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed. <\/a><\/p>\n<p>The man died of Lassa fever, a virus that causes hemorrhagic symptoms but is very different from Ebola, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Lassa fever is only fatal for 1% of those who are infected, while Ebola can be fatal for 70% of those infected without treatment. Lassa fever is also much harder to spread from person to person (it&#8217;s usually picked up from rodent droppings). About 100,000 to 300,000 Lassa fever cases are reported in West Africa every year, resulting in about 5,000 deaths.<\/p>\n<p>The man with Lassa fever had arrived at JFK airport from Liberia on May 17, and went to a hospital the following day complaining of fever, sore throat and tiredness, officials said. At that time, he did not say he had been traveling in West Africa, and he was sent home the same day. On May 21 his symptoms worsened and he returned to the hospital, at which point he was transferred to a facility equipped to deal with viral hemorrhagic fevers. The patient was in &#8220;appropriate isolation&#8221; when he died Monday evening. The CDC is working to compile a list of people who may have encountered the patient while he was sick, and they are monitoring close contacts for 21 days to see if they develop the virus.<\/p>\n<p><span><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"14\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-3933555302001-14\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1duOibZ\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3933555302001\"><\/object><\/div><\/span><\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Health","slug":"health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/health\/","description":"The latest health news, trends, and commentary from TIME, covering medicine, mental health, diet, fitness, sex, aging, disease, healthcare, policy and more","health":true},"tag":{"name":"global health","slug":"global-health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/global-health\/"},"tags":"Africa|diseases|ebola|global health|lassa fever|Liberia|New Jersey|Virus|West Africa","id":3896155,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3896155%2Flassa-fever-death-new-jersey%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1duOibZ","encoded_title":"Man+Dies+of+Rare+Lassa+Fever+in+New+Jersey","twitter_text":"Man%20dies%20of%20rare%20Lassa%20fever%20in%20New%20Jersey%20after%20traveling%20to%20Liberia","twitter_via":"TIMEHealth","social_encoded_url":{"facebook":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3896155%2Flassa-fever-death-new-jersey%2F%3Fxid%3Dfbshare","twitter":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1GANDB9","linkedin":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3896155%2Flassa-fever-death-new-jersey%2F%3Fxid%3Dlinkedinshare","google":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3896155%2Flassa-fever-death-new-jersey%2F%3Fxid%3Dgplusshare","whatsapp":"Man%20dies%20of%20rare%20Lassa%20fever%20in%20New%20Jersey%20after%20traveling%20to%20Liberia%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3896155%2Flassa-fever-death-new-jersey%2F%3Fxid%3Dwhatsappshare"},"ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"Man Dies of Rare Lassa Fever in New Jersey"},"email_title":"Man%20Dies%20of%20Rare%20Lassa%20Fever%20in%20New%20Jersey%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Man%20Dies%20of%20Rare%20Lassa%20Fever%20in%20New%20Jersey%0A%0AHe%20had%20recently%20returned%20from%20traveling%20in%20Liberia%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3896155%2Flassa-fever-death-new-jersey%2F%3Fxid%3Demailshare","outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3896155\/lassa-fever-death-new-jersey\/","desktop_widget_id":"AR_6","mobile_widget_id":"MB_1","widget_id":"AR_6"},"classes":"metered","article_tile_thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/01\/health-syringe-needle-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C90px%2C1817px%2C1817px&resize=74%2C74&quality=65&strip=color"},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3882556\/who-reform-ebola-outbreak-mistakes\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1LdEsX2","title":"WHO Vows Reform After Ebola Outbreak Mistakes","friendly_title":"WHO Vows Reform After Ebola Outbreak Mistakes","post_type":"post","available":true,"time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"show_comments":true,"short_title":"WHO Vows Reform After Ebola Outbreak Mistakes","excerpt":"The agency is establishing a $100 million contingency fund","format":"brief","time":{"pretty":"May 18, 2015","published":"2015-05-18 12:24:06","updated":"2015-05-18 16:24:06","minute":"12:24 pm","short":"5\/18"},"authors":[{"id":207020909,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/alexandra-sifferlin\/","name":"Alexandra Sifferlin","bio":"Alexandra Sifferlin is a writer for TIME.

The demands on WHO were more than ten times greater than ever experienced in the almost 70-year history of this Organization.&#8221; The assembly is the decision-making body of WHO and the meeting is attended by delegates from the WHO member states.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"16\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-3933076472001-16\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1LdEsX2\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3933076472001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<p>Chan told those present at the event that the WHO is making changes to ensure it is better equipped for a similar health-related emergency in the future.<\/p>\n<p>First, the WHO says it is developing a new program specifically focusing on health emergencies that will have performance benchmarks for what must happen 24, 48 and 72 hours after the beginning of an outbreak. The WHO is also establishing a global health emergency workforce and will strengthen its trained emergency response staff through a proposed increase in budget. The agency is also streamlining its managerial and logistical procedures. Lastly, Chan said the agency is establishing a $100 million contingency fund that will be financed through voluntary contributions. This, Chan said, is to make sure the WHO has the necessary resources needed.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I do not ever again want to see this Organization faced with a situation it is not prepared, staffed, funded, or administratively set up to manage,&#8221; said Chan. &#8220;We will move forward on an urgent footing. I plan to complete these changes by the end of the year.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3507006\"

The patient is currently undergoing treatment for the disease.<\/p>\n<p>The worker was volunteering in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone, and on May 7, the volunteer flew from Freetown, Sierra Leone to Rome, stopping in Casablanca, Morocco. The patient had no symptoms at that time. It wasn&#8217;t until May 10, when the patient was already in Italy, that they began to experience symptoms of the virus. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.who.int\/csr\/don\/13-may-2015-ebola\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\">The World Health Organization (WHO) reports<\/a> that the patient isolated themselves in their home before they were transported on the May 11 to the Hospital of Sassari, Sardinia. On May 12th, samples from the patient confirmed that they did indeed have Ebola.<\/p>\n<p>The patient was then transferred from the Hospital of Sassari to he National Institute for Infectious Diseases (INMI) Lazzaro Spallanzani of Rome in a special aircraft.<\/p>\n<p>Since the patient did not start experiencing symptoms until 72 hours after returning to Italy, WHO says it is not necessary to conduct contact tracing of individuals who were on the same plane. Ebola can only be transmitted via the bodily fluids of a symptomatic person.<\/p>\n<p>More than 26,720 cases of Ebola have been reported in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea since the start of the outbreak, and more than 11,000 people have died.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3507162\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Health","slug":"health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/health\/","description":"The latest health news, trends, and commentary from TIME, covering medicine, mental health, diet, fitness, sex, aging, disease, healthcare, policy and more","health":true},"tag":{"name":"ebola","slug":"ebola","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/ebola\/"},"tags":"ebola|ebola africa|ebola doctors|ebola italy|Ebola outbreak|Ebola patient|Guinea|health care worker|Italy|Liberia|patient|Sierra Leone","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/128624230-1-copy.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/128624230-1-copy.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=280","small_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/128624230-1-copy.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=560","large":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/128624230-1-copy.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550","large_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/128624230-1-copy.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=1100"},"credit":"Getty Images","caption":"","alt":"128624230","providers":[],"masonry":{"small_width":300,"small_height":234,"large_width":625,"large_height":487}},"id":3857138,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3857138%2Febola-italy%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1Fe4itg","encoded_title":"Health+Worker+Tests+Positive+For+Ebola+in+Italy","galleries":[{"id":3507162,"slug":"inside-ebola-crisis-moving-photographs","title":"Inside the Ebola Crisis: The Images that Moved them Most","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3507162\/inside-ebola-crisis-moving-photographs\/","type":"normal","hidecount":false,"fullscreen":false,"counterfullscreen":true,"adfrequency":0,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3507162%2Finside-ebola-crisis-moving-photographs%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1tv3jk9","encoded_title":"Inside+the+Ebola+Crisis%3A+The+Images+that+Moved+them+Most","twitter_via":"TIMEHealth","email_title":"Inside%20the%20Ebola%20Crisis%3A%20The%20Images%20that%20Moved%20them%20Most","hasAds":true,"twitter_text":"See%20inside%20the%20Ebola%20crisis%3A%20the%20images%20that%20moved%20them%20most","fb_text":"See%20inside%20the%20Ebola%20crisis%3A%20the%20images%20that%20moved%20them%20most","email_body":"","size":"default","galleries":[{"id":3828576,"title":"See How Children Reacted to One of the First Sex-Ed Films Ever Shown","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/150420-sex-ed-1948-01.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3828576\/sex-education-1940s\/"},{"id":3901783,"title":"6 Foods That Taste Better In June Than They Will All Year","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/167866478-1-copy.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3901783\/fruits-vegetables-season-june\/"},{"id":3883353,"title":"When Shedding a Few Pounds Meant Reaching for Some Milk","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/150518-milk-farm-01.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3883353\/weight-loss-milk-retreat\/"},{"id":3841878,"title":"Celebrate National Nurses Week With a LIFE Cover Story on Nursing in the 1930s","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/150430-nursing-school-01.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3841878\/national-nurses-week\/"},{"id":3842659,"title":"5 Foods That Taste Better in May Than They Will All Year","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/76945128-copy.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3842659\/foods-in-season-farmers-market\/"},{"id":3815680,"title":"How the Polio Vaccine Trials Relieved a Worried Nation","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/150409-polio-vaccine-10.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3815680\/polio\/"}],"photos":[{"id":3507203,"title":"Ebola in Sierra Leone for the Washington Post","slug":"ebola-in-sierra-leone-for-the-washington-post-3","caption":"<b>Pete Muller, Aug. 26, 2014. Sengema, Sierra Leone.<br><br><\/b>\"The rain started shortly after a small team of Red Cross burial workers approached the body. The deceased man, reportedly in his mid-sixties, collapsed and died outside his remote home more than a day before the burial team arrived. Having received instructions from officials that bodies of Ebola victims are extremely contagious, his family members placed a sheet over his body, marked a cordon in the sand, and called the Red Cross. With approximately 20 burial workers serving all of Kailahun district, an area the size of Rhode Island and rife with Ebola, the team had a backlog of cases.<br><br> His family endured the presence of his body, laying prone and exposed to the elements, for more than 24 hours. As the team removed the sheet, the stench of death filled the air. The white cloth around the man\u2019s head was crimson with blood. As burial workers sprayed him with chlorine, family members erupted with emotion. I was moved imagining how I might respond if I were in the situation. To me, this picture represents the range of Ebola\u2019s emotional impact. In the two women, we see the devastation and loss that the virus causes. In the faces of the men, we see a sense of despondence, disbelief and suspicion that also defines the response.

Every time the Red Cross workers do the same thing: they wear protective clothing, interview the family, spray the perimeter and the room, and the body. They carefully open the body bag, carry the body outside for pick up \u2014 sprayers and volunteers facing each other \u2014 and later remove their protective clothing as carefully as they can. Their work is measured, slow: any direct contact with the dead person's body can be dangerous. In this photo, it is all about the gesture. In this chlorinated, silent corridor, there is little else that can convey humanity besides this gesture.

appended, April 23<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Olivia Wilde may be best known for her work onscreen in the likes of <em>House <\/em>and <em>Tron: Legacy<\/em>. But she&#8217;s increasingly getting more involved behind the camera, most recently in producing the documentary short <em>Body Team 12<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The film, which screened at the Tribeca Film Festival and has a planned release in the fall, is directed by aid worker David Darg. It depicts the work a Liberian woman named Garmai Sumo, whose work hauling the bodies of the dead during the Ebola crisis is both arduous and emotionally taxing. In the time since, Sumo has moved from burying the dead to feeding the living and is involved in aiding the orphans of Monrovia through her <a href=\"http:\/\/www.EbolaOrphanProject.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ebola Orphan Project<\/a>. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a wonderful tale of redemption for Garmai,&#8221; Darg says.<\/p>\n<p>The film upsets and overwhelms with scenes of Sumo facing angry families even as she places herself at grave risk, but the film provides viewers uplift in the form of a fairly direct way to support Sumo&#8217;s work today. It emerged from Darg&#8217;s aid work in Liberia; he embedded with a body team along with journalists from the <em>Washington Post <\/em>and China&#8217;s CCTV. Wilde came in at a later stage of production; Darg and producer Bryn Mooser &#8220;approached me about coming on as an executive producer, and I wanted to help in any way I could to facilitate the process and help people see it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a role with which Wilde has grown more and more comfortable. The actress joined Twitter in an attempt to raise money after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. &#8220;That&rsquo;s ancient history now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I&rsquo;ve embraced it for both valuable causes and complete bulls&#8212;.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3831388\"><\/div>\n<p>Wilde, who in recent bookings on TV has brought Darg and Mooser along to speak authoritatively about Ebola, is on the forefront of celebrities who&#8217;ve embraced the power of celebrity to draw attention to causes, even if it erodes mystique.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think a lot of celebrities are coming around to the idea that Twitter and the Internet in all ways is not necessarily as representative of defeat as it was once seen,&#8221; she says. &#8220;When Twitter started, I think a lot of celebrities thought, &#8216;This is the ultimate betrayal of privacy, blah blah blah&#8217;&mdash;that it would ruin all sense of separation between people and celebrities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Instead, though, stars who use social media to promote causes are widely lauded, a change that Wilde pegs to broader societal indulgence of a life online. &#8220;It used to be very separated, and there was this sense of maintaining the illusion, and that an actor had to be anonymous so people would believe you in character. But I think the nature of society has changed and it&rsquo;s happened for everyone, not just celebrities. People share more, and people expect to be shared with. There&rsquo;s just a sense of acceptance of a more complex and dynamic life, a more varied personality.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The one risk, perhaps, is Wilde&#8217;s believability as an actress given how out-front she is as a public persona. She&#8217;s unbothered: &#8220;Maybe there&rsquo;s someone who won&rsquo;t buy me because they&rsquo;ve seen me speaking about Ebola on the <i>Today <\/i>show. Who knows? But that would seem very rigid to me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Correction<\/b>: The original version of this story incorrectly described David Darg, who directed <i>Body Team 12<\/i>. He is an aid worker.<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Entertainment","slug":"entertainment","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/entertainment\/","description":"From esoteric art to Housewives hullaballoo, TIME Culture covers what's good, bad and breaking right now in music, movies, TV, tech, celebrities and style","entertainment":true},"tag":{"name":"movies","slug":"movies","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/movies\/"},"tags":"body team 12|ebola|movies|Olivia Wilde","hero":{"class":"portrait","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/olivia-wilde.jpg?crop=0px%2C212px%2C2835px%2C2835px&resize=100%2C100&quality=65&strip=color","src":{"small":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/olivia-wilde.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=280","small_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/olivia-wilde.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=560","large":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/olivia-wilde.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=407","large_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/olivia-wilde.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=814"},"credit":"Dennis Van Tine\u2014Geisler-Fotopres\/AP","caption":"Olivia Wilde attends the Shorts Program World Pemiere of 'Body Team 12' during the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival at Regal Battery Park 11 on April 19, 2015 in New York City.","alt":"'Home' Premiere, Tribeca Film Festival 2015","providers":[],"masonry":{"small_width":300,"small_height":450,"large_width":625,"large_height":937}},"id":3831388,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3831388%2Folivia-wilde-ebola-social-media%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1DNva14","encoded_title":"Olivia+Wilde+on+Celebs+and+Social+Media%3A+%E2%80%98The+Nature+of+Society+Has+Changed%E2%80%99","twitter_text":"Olivia%20Wilde%20talks%20celebs%20and%20social%20media","twitter_via":"TIMECulture","social_encoded_url":{"facebook":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3831388%2Folivia-wilde-ebola-social-media%2F%3Fxid%3Dfbshare","twitter":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1ySMJ0E","linkedin":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3831388%2Folivia-wilde-ebola-social-media%2F%3Fxid%3Dlinkedinshare","google":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3831388%2Folivia-wilde-ebola-social-media%2F%3Fxid%3Dgplusshare","whatsapp":"Olivia%20Wilde%20talks%20celebs%20and%20social%20media%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3831388%2Folivia-wilde-ebola-social-media%2F%3Fxid%3Dwhatsappshare"},"ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"Olivia Wilde on Celebs and Social Media: 'The Nature of Society Has Changed'"},"email_title":"Olivia%20Wilde%20on%20Celebs%20and%20Social%20Media%3A%20%E2%80%98The%20Nature%20of%20Society%20Has%20Changed%E2%80%99%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Olivia%20Wilde%20on%20Celebs%20and%20Social%20Media%3A%20%E2%80%98The%20Nature%20of%20Society%20Has%20Changed%E2%80%99%0A%0AThe%20actress%20discusses%20her%20Ebola%20documentary%2C%20%22Body%20Team%2012%22%20%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3831388%2Folivia-wilde-ebola-social-media%2F%3Fxid%3Demailshare","outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3831388\/olivia-wilde-ebola-social-media\/","desktop_widget_id":"AR_6","mobile_widget_id":"MB_1","widget_id":"AR_6"},"classes":"metered","article_tile_thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/olivia-wilde.jpg?crop=0px%2C212px%2C2835px%2C2835px&resize=74%2C74&quality=65&strip=color"}]}},"initial_omniture":null,"popularVideos":{"time":[4277475535001,4280190689001,4278259976001,4280656220001,4280379818001,4279935093001,4286301442001,4283972925001,4277787416001,4282796614001,4277843805001,4289544900001,4280839870001,4286652502001,4283598191001,4283024815001,4285656746001,4280908982001,4281381307001,4279377481001],"money":[4278415639001,4288343768001,4278415558001,4278778011001,4285970463001,4288321105001,4288896276001,4290335254001,4293100698001]}}</script><script type='text/javascript' src='//tags.tiqcdn.com/utag/timeinc/time.com/prod/utag.js?ver=4.2-RC4-32277'></script>
